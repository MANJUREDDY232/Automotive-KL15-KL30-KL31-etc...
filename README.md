Traditional ICE cars use a 12V lead-acid battery (KL30) to start the vehicle. Buses and lorries use two 12V batteries in series for 24V. Some hybrids use 48V systems. Most BEVs still use a 12V battery (via KL15) to power up and close HV contactors before the high-voltage system activates.
KL30 is the constant power line from the vehicle battery to the ECU. It supplies voltage at all times—whether the car is on or off—so some ECUs send constant power line like central locking, and alarm can keep running even when the car is off.
KL15 is the ignition signal(ON) from the car key (equivalent to the IGN position). It activates when the key is turned to start the engine and powers critical ECUs like ABS, ESP, and chassis systems.
KL31 is the ECU ground connector, which connects to the vehicle's negative battery terminal. It is generally connected to shared ground points throughout the vehicle, such as the engine, body, chassis, and other locations, to provide a single ground for several ECUs.
KL15R (R = Radio) refers to the ACC position—when the key is turned to power accessories like the radio, dashboard, doors, or windows, but the engine is still off.
KL50 represents the car’s crank mode(Start), Engine Running.
KL40 represents the positive terminal of a 48V battery.
KL41 represents the negative pole of a 48V battery
